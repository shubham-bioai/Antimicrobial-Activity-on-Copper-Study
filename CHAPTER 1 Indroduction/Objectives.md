# Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are as follows:

- **To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of copper** in real-world water storage
conditions by comparing it with non-copper (plastic/glass) containers.

- **To analyze microbial growth** using the **paper disc diffusion method**, a widely
accepted technique in microbiological studies to measure antimicrobial
effectiveness.

- **To measure and compare the zones of inhibition**, if any, formed by water stored
in copper versus non-copper vessels, thereby quantifying microbial suppression.


- **To understand the underlying scientific mechanism** behind copper’s biocidal
effect, particularly its impact on microbial cell structure and function through ion
release and oxidative damage.


- **To provide scientific validation** for traditional practices involving copper in water
storage, with the potential to influence public health strategies in areas lacking
modern water treatment infrastructure.


- **To lay the foundation for future studies** involving copper alloys or comparing
copper’s antimicrobial efficiency with other metals such as silver, brass, or
stainless steel.
