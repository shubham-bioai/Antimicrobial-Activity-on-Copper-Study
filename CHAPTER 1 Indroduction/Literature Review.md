# Literature Review 

The antimicrobial properties of copper have been acknowledged since antiquity, with
early civilizations using copper vessels for storing water to prevent contamination.
However, scientific validation of these traditional practices has emerged more recently.
Several studies have highlighted the potent biocidal action of copper, which operates
through a phenomenon known as oligodynamic action a process by which small
amounts of metal ions exert lethal effects on microbial life. 

- **Grass et al. (2011)** conducted comprehensive research into copper’s antimicrobial
mechanism, illustrating how metallic copper surfaces contribute to the death of bacterial
cells. Their work identified that copper ions cause significant membrane damage,
oxidative stress, and protein denaturation in microorganisms, leading to cell death. This
supports the hypothesis tested in this thesis: that copper can actively reduce microbial
contamination in stored water samples. 

- Building on this, **Vincent et al. (2018)** reviewed the broader antimicrobial capabilities of
copper and its alloys, with a focus on contact killing. They emphasized that copper
surfaces rapidly inactivate a wide range of pathogens, including Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus aureus, and even some viruses and fungi. The review supports the
premise that copper does not just inhibit growth but actively destroys microorganisms
upon contact—an effect demonstrated in this project by the visible zones of inhibition
around copper-treated water discs.


- Studies such as those by **Santo et al. (2011)** (not referenced in your thesis, but highly
relevant) further corroborate these findings, showing that bacteria exposed to copper
surfaces exhibit disrupted membrane potentials and leakage of intracellular contents,
resulting in irreversible damage. This aligns with the current experiment’s observation
that copper-stored water significantly inhibited microbial growth compared to water
stored in plastic or glass.


- The **paper disc diffusion method** used in this study is a standard microbiological
technique for evaluating antimicrobial activity. According to microbiological protocols,
the method effectively demonstrates how a compound (in this case, copper ions
leaching into water) diffuses into the surrounding medium to suppress microbial growth.
The clear zones of inhibition around the discs indicate the presence and strength of
antimicrobial agents, which in this case were only prominent in the copper-treated
sample. 


- Furthermore, the concept of copper induced oxidative stress a process by which
copper ions catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been
widely accepted in microbiological research. These ROS cause widespread damage to
microbial DNA, proteins, and lipids, ensuring effective microbial inactivation (Vincent et
al., 2018). 


- Taken together, these studies provide a solid scientific foundation for the observed
results in this thesis. They demonstrate that copper not only inhibits microbial
proliferation but actively kills microorganisms via multiple complementary mechanisms.
The findings of this experiment are consistent with the current literature, reaffirming the
antimicrobial efficacy of copper and justifying its traditional and modern use in water
purification and public health applications.
