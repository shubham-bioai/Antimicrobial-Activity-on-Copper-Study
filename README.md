# Antimicrobial Activity on Copper  
### Experimental Study on the Antimicrobial Properties of Copper

Copper has been used for centuries as an antimicrobial material. With the rapid rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), non-antibiotic approaches such as metal-based antimicrobial surfaces are gaining renewed importance.  
This project presents a **laboratory-based experimental study** analyzing the **antimicrobial activity of copper** against microorganisms under controlled conditions.

---

## 📌 Abstract

This study investigates the antimicrobial effects of copper materials on microbial growth. Copper ions are known to disrupt microbial cell membranes, damage DNA, and interfere with essential metabolic pathways. The experiment demonstrates copper’s effectiveness as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent and highlights its potential applications in healthcare, sanitation, and infection control.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Study

- To study the antimicrobial activity of copper
- To observe microbial growth inhibition in the presence of copper
- To understand copper’s role as a non-antibiotic antimicrobial agent
- To analyze experimental results and compare them with existing scientific literature

---

## 🧪 Why Copper?

Copper exhibits strong antimicrobial properties due to:

- Release of copper ions (Cu⁺ / Cu²⁺)
- Damage to microbial cell membranes
- Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
- Denaturation of proteins and nucleic acids
- Contact killing effect on microbial cells

Unlike antibiotics, copper acts through **multiple mechanisms**, making it difficult for microbes to develop resistance.
