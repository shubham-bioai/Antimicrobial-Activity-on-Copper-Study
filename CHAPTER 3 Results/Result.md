# Results

- The results of the experiment clearly demonstrated a measurable difference in microbial
activity between water stored in a copper vessel and that stored in a non-copper
(plastic/glass) container. After a 24-hour incubation period, the paper disc diffusion
method revealed visible zones of inhibition around the discs dipped in copper-stored
water, indicating suppression or killing of microorganisms.


- The agar plates inoculated with environmental bacteria showed significant microbial
growth in the control group (normal water), while the test group (copper water) exhibited
reduced or no microbial colonies in the area surrounding the disc. The zone of inhibition
a clear area where bacterial growth was suppressed was consistently larger in samples
stored in copper containers.


### Quantitative Observation

| Sample Type  | Zone of Inhibition (mm) | Microbial Growth Level       |
|--------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Copper Water | 6–10 mm (average: 8 mm) | Significantly reduced growth |
| Normal Water | 0–2 mm (average: 1 mm)  | High bacterial growth        |


- The average zone of inhibition for copper-stored water was found to be around 8 mm,
while the control (plastic/glass container) showed negligible inhibition zones, indicating
little or no antimicrobial activity. In many cases, the non-copper samples exhibited a dense
lawn of bacterial colonies surrounding the paper disc, suggesting unhindered microbial
proliferation.


- Photographic evidence taken before and after incubation also confirmed the visual
differences in microbial growth. The copper-treated samples appeared clearer, with fewer
colonies forming near the disc, while the control samples showed widespread bacterial
coverage.


- These results strongly support the hypothesis that copper possesses significant
antimicrobial properties and can inhibit the growth of waterborne microorganisms.
Moreover, the experiment provides visual and measurable data to validate the traditional
practice of storing water in copper vessels for enhanced microbial safety.
