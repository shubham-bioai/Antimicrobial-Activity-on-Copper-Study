# Conclusion

The experiment successfully demonstrated that copper has potent antimicrobial
properties. Water stored in copper vessels showed significantly reduced microbial
growth compared to water stored in normal containers. These findings support
traditional practices and provide scientific evidence for the use of copper in water
purification systems, particularly in areas lacking access to advanced filtration
technology.
