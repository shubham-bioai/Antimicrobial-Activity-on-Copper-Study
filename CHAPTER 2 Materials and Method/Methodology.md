# Methodology

### 1- Sample Preparation
- Two identical samples of water were collected.
- One sample was placed in a copper vessel, and the other in a normal plastic or glass
container.
- Both samples were kept undisturbed at room temperature for 24 hours.


### 2- Preparation of Agar Plates
- Nutrient Agar was prepared according to standard microbiological procedure and
poured into sterile Petri dishes.
- The plates were allowed to solidify under sterile conditions. 


### 3- Inoculation and Sample Application (Disc Diffusion Method)
- A microbial culture (e.g., water left open to air or inoculated with a small amount of
environmental bacteria) was spread on the agar surface using a sterile swab.
- Paper discs were dipped in each water sample and placed on the agar plates
equidistant from each other.
- The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24-48 hours (or at room temperature if an
incubator was unavailable).
