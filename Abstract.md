# Abstract

Copper has long been revered for its medicinal and antimicrobial properties, with
historical evidence supporting its use in water purification and infection control. This study
aims to scientifically evaluate the antimicrobial activity of copper by comparing microbial
growth in water stored in a copper vessel versus a non-copper (plastic/glass) container.
Using the paper disc diffusion method, water samples were analyzed after 24 hours of
storage. The results demonstrated a significant zone of inhibition around the discs dipped
in copper-stored water, indicating reduced microbial presence. In contrast, the water
stored in plastic or glass containers showed negligible antimicrobial activity. The findings
support the hypothesis that copper ions exert a biocidal effect on microorganisms through
mechanisms such as membrane disruption, oxidative stress, and protein denaturation.
This study not only validates traditional practices but also highlights copper’s potential as
a natural, low-cost antimicrobial agent in public health applications, especially in regions
with limited access to modern filtration systems.
